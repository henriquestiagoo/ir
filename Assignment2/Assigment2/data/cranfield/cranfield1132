<TEXT>
  tests are described of a number of machined-stiffened cylinders
subjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and the observed
general instability strengths compared with predictions
from theories of kendrick and nash .  agreement with kendrick
was found rather good .  results also are presented from electrical
strain gages which show in detail the growth of embryonic
lobes and nonlinear characteristics of deformation at the threshold
of buckling .  weakening effects of imperfect circularity are
discussed .
