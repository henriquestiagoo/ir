<TEXT>
  a blade design for a highly loaded two-stage
turbine is described and the test performance of
the turbine is presented .
  some of the factors affecting the performance and matching
of turbine blade rows operating at supersonic
gas velocity are discussed and investigated by means of tests
on a three-dimensional nozzle cascade tunnel
and on a variety of single-stage turbine builds .
