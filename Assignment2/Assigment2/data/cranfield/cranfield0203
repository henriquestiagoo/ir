  the polygon method of woods is used to
calculate the velocity distribution over a number of twodimensional
aerofoils at low incidence, subcritical flows only
being considered .  lift slopes and aerodynamic centres
at zero lift are also calculated .
  some comparisons with experimental results are made, and
these show good agreement at zero incidence .
