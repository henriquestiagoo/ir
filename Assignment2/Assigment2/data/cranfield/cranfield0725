  an analysis is made of experimentally determined mode shapes
excited on the rear structure of a modern airliner by jet noise from
a pod-mounted turbojet engine .  power spectra of stresses determined
from strain-gage measurements are obtained and cross correlated
.  extensive measurements were made on skin panels of the
fuselage and elevator and limited ones were made on fuselage
stringers and frames .  the skin-panel results are compared with
theoretical predictions .  reviewer believes that this paper is of
considerable value for those concerned with response of aircrafttype
structures to jet-induced noise .
