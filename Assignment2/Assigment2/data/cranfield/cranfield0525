  hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface
mass transfer is studied .  the tangent-wedge approximation
is used in the inviscid-flow region, and the integral method is applied
to the treatment of the laminar boundary layer .  the law
of surface mass transfer for the present analysis is derived .  a
continuous transition of the pressure variation is achieved from
the strong to the weak pressure-interaction region .  first-order
formulas for the induced surface pressure and the skin-friction
coefficient are obtained for both the strong and weak pressureinteraction
regions .  results are compared with those calculated
from other analyses .
