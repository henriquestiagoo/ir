  the flow of a dense plasma over a wavy conducting wall of
small amplitude is investigated where magnetic effects are
negligible .  these results are then used to analyze the flow over
a thin conductor with cusped edges .  it is found that the coulomb
drag vanishes identically, while the fluid-pressure drag
corresponds to the ackeret value for a neutral particle gas at the
reduced-plasma mach number .
