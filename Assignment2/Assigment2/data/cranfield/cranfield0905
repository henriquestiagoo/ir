  comparative tests were made on seven conventional
pitot-static tubes to determine their static, dynamic, and
resultant errors .  the effect of varying the dynamic opening,
static openings, wall thickness, and inner-tube diameter
was investigated .  pressure-distribution measurements
showing stem and tip effects were also made .  a tentative
design for a standard pitot-static tube for use in measuring
air velocity is submitted .
  this report covers an investigation conducted under
the auspices of the national research council .
