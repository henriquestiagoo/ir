  by consideration of antisymmetrical, as well as symmetrical,
buckling configurations, the theoretical shear buckling stresses of
clamped rectangular flat plates are evaluated more correctly than in
previous work .  the results given, which represent the average of upper
and lower-limit solutions obtained by the lagrangian multiplier method,
are within percent of the true buckling stresses .
