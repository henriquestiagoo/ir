  this paper presents an analysis of buckling of simply
supported rectangular plates reinforced by any number of
transverse stiffeners and subjected to shearing forces uniformly
distributed along the edges .  two cases are
considered ..  (a) the case of a plate with a finite length,.
ing stresses in both cases are expressed in similar forms,
that is, in equation (13), and
k in equation (24), respectively .  design
curves are drawn as shown in figs. 2,3, and 5 .
