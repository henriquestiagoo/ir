an approximate method, known as the
heat-balance integral, is used to determine the
melting rate of a finite slab which is initially
at a uniform temperature below the melting
point .  the slab is acted upon by a
constant heat input at one face and has its other
face either insulated or kept at its initial
temperature .  the first three terms of series
solutions in an intrinsically small parameter
are obtained for the time histories of
melting and the temperature distribution in the slab .
