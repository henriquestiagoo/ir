<TEXT>
  a formula for the supersonic velocity field in terms of a given
surface distribution of sources is applied to points lying in the
surface .  an equation giving the camber shape of a quasi circularcylindrical
surface in terms of a prescribed thickness distribution
is derived and the half ring wing with prescribed thickness distribution
is discussed as an example .
