  in this paper, the pressure distribution
at the surface of a symmetrical
non-lifting aerofoil with free stream
mach number of unity has been investigated
by means of the small-disturbance
linear theory or the method of local
linearization .  and by comparing with
the calculated results based on an
hodograph method, the accuracy of these
approximate methods has been evaluated
.  moreover, when these approximate
methods are used for the calculation
of the pressure coefficient, some notes
necessary to obtain more correct results
have been discussed .
