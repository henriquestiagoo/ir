  experimental results gathered in recent years for binary
mixture mass transfer models are shown to yield consistent evidence
of discrepancies with analytic considerations .  specifically,
measured recovery temperatures are appreciably higher than those
predicted ,. while heat transfer coefficients are satisfactorily reproduced
.  it is shown on the basis of both approximate and exact
solutions for plates and stagnation points that the discrepancies in
previous results are related to thermal diffusion effects, a major
influence being apparent in application of the surface boundary
condition for an adiabatic wall .  as a result, some reexamination is
necessary of past criteria for mass addition effects as they pertain to
specific injected media .  a prime example is the /equivalence/ of
helium and air as coolants despite the heretofore suggested preference
for low density injectants on a perfect gas basis .  ref. 16 .
