the equations are given for the laminar boundary-layer
equations on a yawed infinite wing for constant
wall temperature, under the combined howorth and
mangler transformation .  diagrams show the relatively
small influence of yaw, the increase of boundary-layer
secondary flow, and the variation of the local heat
transfer rate with yaw .
