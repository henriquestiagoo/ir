  a theoretical study is made of the buckling of a sandwich sphere
comprised of a core layer of low-modulus material and two thin
facing layers of higher modulus material .  the solution for the
buckling resistance of the sphere under normal external pressure
is obtained by linearized theory, and is reducible to the classical
solution for monocoque spherical shells .  critical buckling pressures
are calculated for various radius-thickness ratios and sphere
materials .
