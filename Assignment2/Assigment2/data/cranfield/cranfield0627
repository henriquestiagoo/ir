  the flutter problem of flat circular panels with edges elastically
restrained against rotation has been formulated in terms of smalldeflection
plate theory .  the panel is subjected to uniform allround
tension or compression in its middle plane, in addition to
the supersonic compressible flow passing over its upper surface
with still air below .  linear piston theory is employed to predict
the aerodynamic load on the vibrating panel .
  the problem is investigated by a rayleigh-type analysis involving
chosen modes of the panel as degrees of freedom .
  in order to investigate the convergence of the solution, the
flutter-mode shape of the clamped-edge panel has been expressed
in a series form in powers of r cos o .  the results of three-, four-,
and five-term approximations have displayed oscillatory behavior
with apparently rapid convergence of the solution .
