  inequality constraints are introduced into the variational
formulation of the optimum re-entry problem for a lifting vehicle
to prevent human and or structural tolerances from being
exceeded .  these constraints consist of minimum and maximum
angle of attack, maximum load factor, and maximum convective
heat transfer (equilibrium temperature) .
  the equations have been programed for the ibm 704 computer,
and sample trajectories are presented for which the total
heat transferred to certain critical areas on the windward surface
of the vehicle is minimized .  these trajectories indicate the
dominant effect of the constraints on the optimum flight path,
which is shown to consist of both unconstrained and constrained
arcs .
