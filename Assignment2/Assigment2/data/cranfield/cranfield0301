<TEXT>
a modified parabolic curve appears to be in close proximity to that
obtained by either the method of characteristics or the wave method .
thus an attempt has been made to use analytic geometry to determine
approximately the contour of a two-dimensional, sharp-cornered
supersonic nozzle in a very short time .
