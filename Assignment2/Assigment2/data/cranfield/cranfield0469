  the simple linearized transonic flow theory
as originally proposed by oswatitsch and
keune(1) and by the present authors (2)
is improved by considering and partially
correcting its error .  in this manner a theory
which is easy to apply and which should
be valid for a great number of smooth bodies
is obtained .  this improved theory predicts
shock waves in the lower transonic regions .
it is applied to a number of significant
body and airfoil shapes and its predictions are
compared with experiments and results
of other theoretical investigations .
