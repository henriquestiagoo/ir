  the free-convection flow and heat transfer of an
electrically conducting fluid on a vertical
plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic
field is analysed for a magnetic field
fixed to the electrically non-conducting wall .  the
boundary layer equations for selfpreserving
flows are integrated numerically for the
prandtl number of unity, and the effect
of the transverse magnetic field on the velocity
profile, temperature profile and rate of
heat transfer is discussed .  it is concluded that
the heat transfer rate is reduced as the
magnetic field intensity is increased .
