  this note describes transient wall
temperature measurements made on a
in an airstream of mach number 6.8 .
  the skin of the model was
sufficiently thin to allow it to reach zero
heat transfer conditions within a
running time of one minute .
  in order to reduce effects
of longitudinal heat conduction during a
run the electroformed-nickel skin
of the model was made with graded
thickness, and as a result fairly
uniform temperature distributions along
the surface were obtained at all
times in both the laminar and turbulent
regions .
  values of heat transfer, calculated from the wall temperature-time
histories using the thin-wall
temperature are compared to theoretical
estimates using the intermediate
enthalpy method 10, 11 .
