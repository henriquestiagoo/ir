  a modified method of van driest's flat-plate theory for turbulent
boundary layer has been found to simplify the calculation of local skinfriction
coefficients which, in turn, have made it possible to obtain
through reynolds analogy theoretical turbulent heat-transfer coefficients
in the form of stanton number .  a general formula is given and
charts are presented from which the modified method can be solved for
mach numbers 1.0 to 12.0, temperature ratios 0.2 to 6.0, and reynolds
numbers 0.2 x 10 to 200 x 10 .
