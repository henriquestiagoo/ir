<TEXT>
  the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinders subjected
to compression and bending are presented and discussed .  the
results obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from those
obtained by previous investigators in that the theoretical smalldeflection
compressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achieved
in each test .  small amounts of internal pressure had a greater stabilizing
effect in the bending tests than in the compression tests .
