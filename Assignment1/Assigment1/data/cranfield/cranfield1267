<TEXT>
  the inviscid rotational supersonic flow behind the shock wave
attached to the sharp leading edge of an airfoil is studied by a
transformation of coordinates which introduces the crocco stream
function as an independent variable .
  using expansions in the power series of, an iterative process
is developed for the determination of pressure distribution along
the airfoil surface .
