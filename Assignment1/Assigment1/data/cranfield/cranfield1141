  the incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillating
vehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, and
the assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetric .
time-wise drag variations are thus represented as changes in the
wake diameter and velocity defect .  it is shown that the unsteadiness
in this flow can be predicted by a quasi-steady theory .
