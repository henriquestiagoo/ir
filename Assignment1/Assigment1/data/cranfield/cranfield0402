  a mathematical treatment of the coupled motion of
hydrodynamic flow and electromagnetic fields is
given .  two simplifying assumptions are introduced ..  first,
the conductivity of the medium is infinite, and
second, the motion is described by a plane shock wave .
various orientations of the plane of the shock and
the magnetic field are discussed separately, and the
extreme relativistic and unrelativistic behavior is
examined .  special consideration is given to the behavior
of weak shocks, that is, of sound waves .  it is
interesting to note that the waves degenerate into common
sound waves and into common electromagnetic
waves in the extreme cases of very weak and very strong
magnetic fields .
