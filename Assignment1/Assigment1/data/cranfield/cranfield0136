  existing configurations of supersonic portion of rocket nozzles
are described and compared .  survey covers bell-type conical and
contoured nozzles, annular nozzles, plug nozzles, and the author's
own /e-d/ (expansion-deflection) nozzle .  the latter is a belltype
nozzle in which the gases are first deflected radially outward
by a small central plug, then expanded radially inward around the
base of the plug, and finally deflected back to a nearly axial direction
by the nozzle wall, in compressive turning .
