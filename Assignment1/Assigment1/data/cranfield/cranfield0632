  in the course of a larger survey of some aerodynamic characteristics
of a family of sweptback wings, the low-speed lift distributions were
calculated .  the 35 planforms considered cover a range of leading-edge
sweep angles from 55 to 70, and aspect ratios from 2 to 3.9 .  the
results are given here, together with a comparison with other
calculations and with experimental results on one particular wing .
