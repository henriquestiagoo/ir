based on prandtl's mixing-length mechanism, the pressure
equation for turbulent flow in
slider-bearing lubrication is derived .  an analytical
solution is given and compared with
the one for laminar flow .  it is found that the turbulent
effect increases the pressure and
consequently, the load-carrying capacity .  however, the
power loss also increases .
