  a theoretical solution is given for the critical shear stress of
an infinitely long, simply supported, flat plate with identical, equally
spaced, transverse stiffeners of zero torsional stiffness .  results are
obtained by means of the lagrangian multiplier method and are presented
in the form of design charts .  experimental results are included and
are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results .
