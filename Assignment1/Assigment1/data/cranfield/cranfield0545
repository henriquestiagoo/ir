  the flow around slender wing-fin
configurations having curved leading
edges, whose shape is defined by polynomials,
is considered .  a general
expression for the pressure distribution
on such a configuration in
asymmetric flow is derived and the
derivatives due to the particular case
of sideslipping motion are also given .
no numerical results are given for
wing-fin load distribution, but the
sideslip derivatives have been
evaluated in a number of cases for
gothic and ogee wings .
