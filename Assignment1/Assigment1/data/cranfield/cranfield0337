the mass-injection process has been proposed as a method
of cooling aerodynamic surfaces, and, since the amount of
coolant required to maintain practical wall temperatures is considerably
larger for turbulent than for laminar boundary layers,
knowledge of the effect of the cooling method on the transition
process is certainly important .  exploratory studies reported
here were conducted at mach number 3.7 to ascertain the effects
of gas injection on the stability of the laminar boundary
layer on a conical surface .
