  the camber and twist distributions
needed to produce a constant spanwise
-distribution and certain linear
chordwise load distributions have
been calculated by linearised supersonic
theory at for a set of 34
thin sweptback wings .  the wing planforms
cover a range of aspect ratios
from 2.0 to 3.5 and leading-edge sweep
angles from 55 to 70 .  both leading
and trailing edges are subsonic at the
design mach number, and the slenderness
parameter is between 0.19 and 0.40 .
  the lift-dependent vortex and wave
drags associated with these loadings
have also been calculated, and appear not
to be excessive in almost all the
cases considered .
