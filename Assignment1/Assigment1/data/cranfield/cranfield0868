  a description is given of the n.g.t.e. thermal shock analogue which
is suitable for estimating the temperature in a turbine blade section as
a function of position and time when the blade is subjected to a step
change in gas temperature .  the method of operating the analogue and
obtaining results has also been described .
  the limitations of the analogue have been stated, but they are
considered a small penalty in view of the essential simplicity of the
design .
