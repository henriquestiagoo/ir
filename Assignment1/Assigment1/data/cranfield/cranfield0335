<TEXT>
experiments of transonic flow past a circular arc profile show that the
shock-wave pattern and the pressure distribution are strongly dependent
upon the state of the boundary layer . a change from laminar to
turbulent boundary layer at a given mach number changes the flow pattern
 considerably .
shock waves can interact with the boundary layer in a manner similar to
a reflection from a free jet boundary . these shock waves are not
distinctly discernible from pressure distribution measurements .
