<TEXT>
  a two-dimensional wind-tunnel
investigation of the pressure distributions
over several naca 16-series
airfoils with thicknesses of
and design lift coefficients of
the langley airfoil test apparatus
at transonic mach numbers from 0.7 to
number from 2.4 x 10 to 2.8 x 10 and
in angle of attack from -10 to
and schlieren flow photographs
are presented without analysis .
