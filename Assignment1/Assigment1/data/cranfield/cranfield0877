  this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity of a thin wing due
to the presence of middle-surface stresses resulting from aerodynamic
heating .  the spanwise properties of the wing are assumed constant but
the wing section is arbitrary .  the loss of flexural rigidity is
comparable with the corresponding loss of torsional rigidity .
