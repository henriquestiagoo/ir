  the authors repeat the earlier calculations of piercy
and winny (proc. roy. soc. london. ser. a. 140 (1933),
earlier works were known to be different from each other .
the careful analysis of the present authors shows that the
skin-friction coefficient up to the second approximation
agrees perfectly with that of piercy and winny .
