  by using a karman-pohlhausen method
the distribution of local rate of heat
transfer is ovaluated for the case of air flow
in an axisymmetrical laminar boundary
layer on a heated circular cylinder, the temperature
of the cylinder being independent
of downstream distance .  this calculation
serves to link the numerical values
obtained by seban, bond, and kelly
for small downstream distances to those obtained
by bourne and davies for large
downstream distances .
