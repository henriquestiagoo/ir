  from an analysis of the work of
crocco and others, semi-empirical formulae
are derived for the skin friction on a
flat plate at zero incidence with a laminar
boundary layer .  these formulae are
for the general case of heat transfer, and
when there is no heat transfer .
  the problem of heat transfer and
the effect of radiation are discussed in the
light of these formulae .  the second
formula is then utilised in the development of
an approximate method for solving the
momentum equation of the boundary layer
on a cylinder without heat transfer .
the method indicates that with increase of
mach number there is a marked forward
movement of separation from a flat plate
in the presence of a constant adverse velocity gradient .
