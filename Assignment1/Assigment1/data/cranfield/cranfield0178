  it is pointed out that, for shock mach numbers between 1 and
that the adjustments in the energy in all the degrees of freedom
proceed slowly and in parallel and occur over a distance large
compared with the mean free path .  theoretical velocity profiles
for such shock waves are given and found to be in excellent agreement
with interferometric shock-tube observations .
