<TEXT>
  newtonian flow theory has been used to develop a procedure
for the design of minimum drag bodies of revolution having a
given thickness ratio and center of pressure .
  it is shown that the optimum body shape is independent of
lift .  center of pressure location, however, exerts a powerful
influence on both the shape of the body and on the drag coefficient
at zero lift .
