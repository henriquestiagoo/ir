  a linear eighth-order equilibrium differential equation for
plastic buckling of geometrically orthotropic thin cylindrical
shells is derived .  this equation is used to obtain explicit solutions
for long flat plates and wide columns under axial compression
and moderate-length cylinders under external pressure, torsion,
and axial compression .
