<TEXT>
  experiments are reported on the interaction of turbulent
boundary layers and shock waves with sweptback configurations .
they show that the peak pressure rise at separation, the upstream
influence ahead of separation, and the pressure rise at reattachment
for moderate sweep angles can all be understood by
simple extensions of available two-dimensional theories .
