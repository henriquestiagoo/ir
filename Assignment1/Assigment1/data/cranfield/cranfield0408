<TEXT>
  stationary convective motion of a conducting fluid
between vertical parallel plates in a magnetic
field is considered .  an exact solution of the
magnetohydrodynamic equations is obtained
for the case of a constant vertical temperature
gradient .  the critical value of grasshof's
number is determined for the case when the
temperature of both plates is the same .
