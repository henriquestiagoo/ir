  theoretical and experimental results are presented
for the discontinuity stresses arising at a
change of wall thickness in a cylinder, a cylinderhemisphere
junction, and a cone-spherical torus
junction in pressure vessels .  the effect of mismatch
of nonconcurrence of the middle surfaces of two
joined cylinders is considered .  in addition, a cylinder
with a special closure which has considerably
reduced stresses is described, and curves with theoretical
and experimental stresses are presented .
