in first approximation, dissociated air may be treated as a binary
mixture of air atoms and air molecules .  in order to include the
effects of mass transfer into the boundary layer, it becomes necessary
to introduce a third chemical species and hence a second diffusion
equation .  we have avoided this complexity by considering the injection
of air molecules into the boundary layer, and hence the theoretical
treatment is accomplished within the framework of a binary mixture gas .
