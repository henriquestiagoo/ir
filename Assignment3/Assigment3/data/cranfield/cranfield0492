<TEXT>
various approximations are being suggested for obtaining surface
pressures on arbitrary bodies at angle of attack .  this not presents
a method for obtaining an approximate pressure distribution over
the lower surface of an ogive forebody at angle of attack by utilizing
the calculated pressures for zero angle of attack .
