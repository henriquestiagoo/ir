pressure measurements were made on a slender cone-cylinder-flare configuration,
slightly blunted at the nose, for 0, 3 and 6 degrees incidence
at a free-stream mach number of 6.8 .
it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed with
 extrapolations to m equals 6.8 of theoretical values given in m.i.t.
tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gave a good indication
of the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the body
where surface incidence was sufficiently large to merit its use .
the semi-angles of the conical and flared parts of the model were both
the pressure level on the flare rose in all cases to approximately that
developed upstream on the cone surface .
no evidence of a marked over-expansion to pressures below the freestream
value was noticed at the junction between cone and cylinder .
