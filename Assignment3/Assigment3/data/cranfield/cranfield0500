  the steady, fully developed, laminar, free-convection flow of an
electrically conducting fluid between two fully submerged openended,
constant-temperature vertical plates located in a constant,
uniformly distributed, transverse magnetic field has been analyzed
with the joule heating term retained in the energy equation .  analytic
results are obtained .  such analytic results are useful in estimating
the actual magnitude of the influence of joule heating as
well as a qualitative description of the manner in which it alters
the temperature and flow fields .  the present result confirms the
usual practice that the influence of joule heating is negligibly
small .
