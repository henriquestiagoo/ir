  recently, it was observed that the two existing boundarylayer
texts (references 1 and 2) did not contain a solution
for the case of couette flow with a constant, uniformly distributed
suction or blowing .  thus, the following analysis considers
a /couette-type/ flow between a stationary flat surface and
a slightly inclined flat plate moving at a constant velocity .  in
addition, the flow is subjected to a constant, uniformly distributed
suction or blowing at the fixed surface .
