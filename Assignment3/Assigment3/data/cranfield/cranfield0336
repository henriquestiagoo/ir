  since the introduction of momentum methods in boundarylayer
calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many improvements
have been proposed .  an especially simple solution
reduces the problem to a quadrature .  here, it is proposed to extend
these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and to
compressible laminar boundary-layer calculations .  for comparison,
the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundary
layer are also discussed briefly .
