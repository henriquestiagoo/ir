this note describes the manner in which the onset of the effects of
boundary-layer separation varies with mach number for two-dimensional
aerofoils, and discusses the influence of section shape as far as it is
known . a brief qualitative description is given of the mechanism
underlying the development of the separated flow and its effects,
followed by a discussion of some of the ways in which this is likely to
differ for swept-back wings at high speeds . finally, the need is
emphasized for continued work in a broadening field .
