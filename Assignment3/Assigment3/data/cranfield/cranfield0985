a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors of
given blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics has
been developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theory .
axial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived from
tangential pressure gradients are included .
the method was applied to the design of an impeller in order to determine
the approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing that
could be used . three numerical solutions for different streamline
spacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, and prescribed
velocity distribution along the hub . the shroud profiles obtained
from the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, and 9 streamtubes,
were negligibly different . the approximate computing time required
was 15 hours per streamtube .
