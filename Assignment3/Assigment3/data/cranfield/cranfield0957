  the authors give a brief account
of some of their recent analytical and
numerical studies of cone buckling,
limiting the discussion to axisymmetric
deformations .
  pertinent numerical results for the
relaxation buckling of full cones subjected
to uniform external pressure and
belleville springs deformed by axial
edge loads are presented .  in addition,
bifurcation buckling problems are discussed
.  for a specific case, the existence
of friedrichs' intermediate buckling
load, as applied to cones, is established .
upper and lower bounds for
its value are given .
