  the general bending theory of shells under the influence of
initial stress presented recently by herrmann and armenakas
is applied in this investigation to study the effect of initial uniform
circumferential stress, uniform bending moment and uniform
radial shear on the dynamic response of an infinitely long
cylindrical shell .
