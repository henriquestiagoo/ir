  a semi-circular ring wing with a body of revolution on
the axis is studied to find the wave and the vortex drag for
various chordwise lift distributions and for three values of
a parameter describing the wing geometry .  using the
wave drag obtained from the chordwise loading that gives the
least drag, together with the vortex and skin friction drags,
the maximum lift to drag ratio for each wing geometry is
computed .  compared to the estimates made by lomax and heaslet,
somewhat lower drags are found .
