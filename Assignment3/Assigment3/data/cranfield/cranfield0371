in a recent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data on
flows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted
tips .  since the demarcation between the supersonic and hypersonic
regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows
to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--especially
where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the
entire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's
results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15 halfangle
cones at m = 2.45 .  following the observation by charters
and stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones
imply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the
convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone
with truncated tip .  they employ the mach-zehnder interferometer
and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools .
