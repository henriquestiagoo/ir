  a general method is described for calculating, with the aid of
an electronic computer, the potential flow about arbitrary bodies
of revolution whose axes are perpendicular to the free-stream
direction .  when combined with the solution for the axisymmetric
flow about these bodies, this method makes it possible to
calculate the pressure distribution on any body of revolution at
angle of attack forward of any separated region of the flow, and
also to calculate the flow at points off the body surface .  after
the basic equations of the method have been derived, its accuracy
is exhibited by comparison with analytic solutions for ellipsoids
of revolution .  calculated pressure distributions are then compared
with experimental data for a variety of bodies .  the
agreement is quite satisfactory in all cases .  the calculated
velocities for other selected bodies are presented to exhibit certain
properties of this type of flow .
