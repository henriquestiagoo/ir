<TEXT>
the incompressible laminar boundary layer
on a semi-infinite flat plate is considered,
when the main stream has uniform
shear .  a solution is obtained for
the first two terms of an asymptotic solution
for small viscosity .  it is shown that
one of the principal effects of free-stream
vorticity is to introduce a modified
pressure field outside the boundary-layer region .
