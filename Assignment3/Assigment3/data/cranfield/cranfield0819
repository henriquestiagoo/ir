<TEXT>
the stresses in the plastic range around a normally loaded circular hole
in an infinite sheet are found numerically on the basis of both
deformation and incremental theories .  the results of deformation
theory are quantitatively assessed in the light of a criterion, recently
developed by budiansky, for the acceptability of deformation theories .
the criterion is completely satisfied .  moreover, the results obtained
by using these two different theories of plasticity do not differ
greatly despite the fact that the stress paths are far from being
radial .
