  a small-deflection theory for general instability of orthotropic
circular cylindrical shells has been derived for external pressure,
torsion, and axial compression .  for the first two types of loading,
comparison of the theory with experimental data for orthotropic
cylinders reveals agreement comparable with that obtained
for isotropic shells .  for axial compression, experimental
data have been found to agree reasonably well with theory for
orthotropic cylinders, in contrast to the agreement usually obtained
for isotropic cylinders .
