  an approximate theory of the base pressure in two-dimensional flow
at supersonic speeds is presented using asimplified representation of
the flow and some of the findings of tollmien's work on turbulent mixing
in incompressible flow .  good qualitative predictions of the effects of
a boundary layer, of bleed air and of boat-tailing are obtained .
