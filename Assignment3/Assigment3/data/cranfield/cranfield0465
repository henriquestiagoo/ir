<TEXT>
  several slender wings of delta planform with sharp edges have been
investigated theoretically at zero lift at subsonic and at supersonic
speeds .  most of the wings have diamond-shaped cross sections and are
intended to lead to a type of flow with leading-edge separation in the
lifting condition .  the pressure distributions and overall normalpressure
drags resulting from various theoretical methods are compared
with one another and some discussion is included concerning the
possibility of achieving the results, calculated for an inviscid stream,
in a real flow in the presence of a viscous layer around the body .
