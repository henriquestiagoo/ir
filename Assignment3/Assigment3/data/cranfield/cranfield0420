a series of experiments was performed to define the flow field on the
upper surface of high aspect ratio swept wings and narrow delta wings at
 high angles of attack .
it was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flow
is conical . the edge of the vortex sheet which originates at the leading
edge is a straight line whose position relative to the leading edge
depends only on incidence . on swept wings, the vortex edge turns downstream
as soon as the vortex sheet covers the front half of the wing
chord, and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turning
point is uniform and parallel to the leading edge of the wing . on narrow
delta wings, the conical symmetry persists almost to the trailing
edge .
