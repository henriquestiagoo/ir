an attempt has been made to identify the significant factors governing
the thermal-fatigue behaviour of nickel-base high-temperature alloys,
mainly by using a laboratory technique with hot and cold fluidized beds
as the heating and cooling media .  a succession of heating shocks is
generally more damaging than a succession of cooling shocks between the
same temperature limits .  the duration of the heating shock and the
upper temperature of the cycle are dominant factors .  the thermalfatigue
cracks are initiated at the surface and are intercrystalline in
origin and propagation .  surface oxidation, which is intergranular in
nature for nickel-base alloys, has a significant effect on thermalfatigue
life .
