analysis of the influence various aerodynamic parameters have on
the performance of a simple peripheral jet system .  power weight
ratio, lift drag ratio, and effect of jet angles and thickness are

and dynamic stability over waves are examined and then related
to the economics of ground-effect machine operation .
