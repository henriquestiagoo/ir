  the method of belotserkovskii for calculating hypersonic
flow fields past a circular cylinder is extended to deal with axiallysymmetric
flow past sharp-cornered nose shapes, in particular,
spherical segments and flat-headed cylinders .  results on
spheres are also included .  in the present paper belotserkovskii's
first approximation is considered, and comparison of calculated
pressure distribution and shock shape with experimental results
shows very good agreement .
