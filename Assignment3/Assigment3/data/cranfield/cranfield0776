  results are given of measurements in the compressed air tunnel
of the forces on two cylinders, one of square cross-section and the
other dodecagonal .  the tests were carried out at various reynolds
numbers ranging from approximately 0.1 x 10 to 5.5 x 10, based on
the distance between parallel faces .
