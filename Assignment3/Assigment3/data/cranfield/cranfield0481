  analytical predictions are given for the development of
the velocity, temperature and concentration fields in a
laminar air boundary layer on a flat plate in high-speed
dissipative flow, the plate being considered porous and
cooled by injection of hydrogen from its surface .  the
admixture of hydrogen, having a low density and high
thermal capacity relative to air, is shown to greatly diminish
the skin friction and to markedly relieve the adverse
thermal effects of intense aerodynamic heating under
conditions of hypersonic flow .
