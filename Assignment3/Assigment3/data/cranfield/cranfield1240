  a new method is presented for predicting the boundary-layer
characteristics downstream of the porous region of an injectioncooled
surface .  the method consists of a general scheme for
obtaining nonsimilar solutions of the compressible-laminarboundary-layer
equations and is formulated along the following
lines .  the viscous domain is divided into n curvilinear strips .
the governing equations are then integrated along the coordinate
normal to the body from the surface to the boundary of each
strip .  as a result, one obtains a set of independent integrodifferential
relations .  the integration is carried out by expressing
the integrands as polynomials, the coefficients of which
are functions of the unknown values of the velocity and temperature
on the strip boundaries as well as of the imposed boundary
condition at the wall and at the outer edge .  after the
integration is performed, a set of ordinary first-order differential
equations is obtained .  the set of equations may be solved for
given initial conditions by a numerical integration scheme such
as the runge-kutta method .  several numerical examples of
interest are presented .
