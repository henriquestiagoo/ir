  van gorcum has pointed to interesting and important analogies
between the theory of a passive four-pole and the conduction of heat
waves through stratiform bodies .  this paper generalizes in certain
regards van gorcum's ideas and draws their consequences for the case of
a solid, bounded by two infinite parallel planes and consisting of any
number of layers made from different materials .
