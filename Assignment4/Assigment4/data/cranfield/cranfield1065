  a five-stage rocket-propelled researchvehicle
system was flown to a maximum
mach number of 13.1 at an altitude of
approximately 78,000 feet to determine
ablation characteristics of teflon in free
flight .  continuous in-flight measurements
were made using sensors developed by
the national aeronautics and space
administration .  the sensors were located
on the blunted face of a nose cone constructed
from teflon, with one at the stagnation
point and two others at a surface
distance of 0.62 radius on opposite sides of the
stagnation point .  the ablatedlength
measurements were in close agreement with
analytical predictions .  the
analytical predictions, upon inclusion of the
pertinent material property values,
should be applicable to other materials as well
as teflon .
