<TEXT>
  a numerical method is developed for calculating the minimum
thickness drag for a given wing planform and volume using
linearized supersonic flow theory .  the corresponding optimum
volume distribution is also determined .  the results show that
considerable drag reduction is possible by improved volume
distribution .
