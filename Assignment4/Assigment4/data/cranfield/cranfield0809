  an investigation of the effect
of lift on sonic-boom intensity has
been performed by means of wind-tunnel
measurements of the pressure fields
surrounding small wing-body combinations .
the tests were conducted in
the langley 4- by 4-foot supersonic
pressure tunnel at a mach number of
per foot .  effects of lift were
found to be real and significant .
measured bow-shock intensities agreed
fairly well with, but were consistently
less than, shock intensities
estimated by theoretical methods .
available flight data were examined
for correlation with wind-tunnel test
results .
