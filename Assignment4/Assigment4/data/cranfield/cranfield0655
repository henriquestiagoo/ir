<TEXT>
results are presented of an investigation to determine the effect of
boundary-layer displacement and leading-edge bluntness on surfaces in
hypersonic flow . the presence of the boundary layer and the blunt
leading edge induce pressure gradients which in turn affect the skin
friction and heat transfer to the surface . methods for predicting these
 phenomena on two-dimensional surfaces are given and a brief review of
recent three-dimensional results is presented .
