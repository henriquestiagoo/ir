the equations of motion of a tumbling flat plate entering an exponential
 atmosphere were linearized and solved analytically to obtain a simple
expression for the altitude at which tumbling would cease and libration
would commence . the plate had only three degrees of freedom, and
aerodynamic forces were derived from newtonian impact theory . in the
linear analysis, mean values of the drag and pitch damping coefficients
so that flutter occurs in the range of a low-speed wind tunnel .
a particular type of construction for supersonic flutter models is described
in detail . methods of vibration testing, static testing, and
flutter testing are discussed . particular emphasis is placed on the
technique of varying flow parameters rather than model parameters to
precipitate flutter . the tool for varying flow parameters is the
variable mach number supersonic test section of the massachusetts institute
of technology blowdown wind tunnel . the aerodynamic features of
 the supersonic test section are presented .
