the present paper contains a set of tables of complete elliptic
integrals computed and collected especially for applications to certain
dynamical problems .
the tabulated functions are four in number and are denoted by
f/a/, g/a/, e/a/, and/a,b/respectively . the definitions of these
functions and their connections with the functions of legendre will be
discussed in the following .
