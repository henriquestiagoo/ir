  the electrical conductivity of an ionized
gas is anisotropic in the presence
of magnetic field (hall effect) .
the conductivity is expressed by
a tensor in the same form for both fully
and partially ionized gases .  by
the use of modified ohm's law and
conventional magnetohydrodynamical
equations the incompressible viscous
flow between parallel plates under
the transverse magnetic field is analyzed
and an exact solution is obtained
when the magnetic reynolds number
is small .  the numerical results
reveal a remarkable effect of anisotropy
of conductivity .  the acceleration
and deceleration of viscous ionized
gas under combined electric and
magnetic fields are also calculated .
