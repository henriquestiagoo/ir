  the value of the compressive stress at which
a thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has been
worked out theoretically by southwell (1914) .  subsequent
experimental results, however, have indicated that this
value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion
which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .
  in recent years much work has been done on this problem
in america .  lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)
have concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatly
influenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and
tsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can be
maintained in a buckled state by a compressive load
considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .
  the present paper is an extension of the work of von karman
and tsien .  it shows that the smallest load which will
keep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third
of that given by southwell, a result in very fair
agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,
and so long as the stresses remain within the elastic
range of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its
original stiffness .
