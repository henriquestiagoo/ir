  this note presents a simplification of a method for calculating
the ratio of local to stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients
on a yawed, infinite, circular cylinder in laminar compressible
flow .  a brief description of the method of ref. 1 is
presented, followed by a discussion of the assumptions and mathematical
procedure which lead to a considerable simplification .
