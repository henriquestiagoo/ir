<TEXT>
the experimentally determined interaction effects of a side jet exhausting
near the base of an ogive-cylinder model are presented and
discussed . the interaction force appears to be independent of mainstream
mach number, boundary-layer condition /laminar or turbulent/,
angle of attack, and forebody length . the ratio of interaction force to
 jet force is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of
the product of jet stagnation-to-free-stream pressure ratio and jet-tobody
diameter ratio .
