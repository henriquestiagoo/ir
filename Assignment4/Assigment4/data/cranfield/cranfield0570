  analytical solutions of the prandtl boundary-layer equations are obtained
for the problem of the /strong/ interaction between the leadingedge
shock and the viscous layer over a flat plate at hypersonic
velocities .  as the mach number increases and the interaction region
spreads downstream over the plate, the local skin-friction coefficient
increases rapidly over its conventional value .  the local heat-transfer
coefficient at first remains practically unaffected but then also begins
to increase with mach number .
