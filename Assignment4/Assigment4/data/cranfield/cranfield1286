  charts are presented covering
a wide range of reflected-shock
wind-tunnel operating conditions, using
nitrogen as the working gas .  a
statistical-mechanical model of the gas
is assumed which takes account of
molecular vibration, electronic excitation
and dissociation .  the gas is
assumed to be constantly in equilibrium that
is, the reaction rates are
taken to be infinitely fast .  the equations
of motion are solved with the
aid of a digital computer, previously reported
results for the state of the
shock-processed gas in the shock-tube being used .
