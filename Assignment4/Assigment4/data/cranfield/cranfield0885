<TEXT>
  the buckling of a thin cylindrical shell simply supported
along the perimeter of its end sections is analyzed under
hoop compressive stresses varying in the axial direction .
the thermal stresses arising from a uniform increase in
the temperature of the cylinder are determined .  it is
found that such thermal stresses are not likely to cause
elastic buckling .  simple approximate formulas are developed
for buckling stress and thermal stress .
