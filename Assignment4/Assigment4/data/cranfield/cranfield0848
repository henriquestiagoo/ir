<TEXT>
  the free oscillations of a thin pressurized cylindrical shell containing
a compressible fluid are studied here .  the use of an
approximate set of shell equations (shallow shell theory) leads to
a relatively simple formula for the natural frequencies of the
coupled fluid-cylinder system .  the results of some computations
are presented .
