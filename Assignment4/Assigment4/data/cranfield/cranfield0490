  the magnetic-field vector is perpendicular to the flow direction,.
thus for normal shocks there is no change of flow direction through
the shock front .  this class of shocks is included in investigations
by several authors (five are referred to here), but the presentation
here is thought to be especially convenient .  all downstream
quantities are given in terms of upstream flow conditions,
including the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed, and
the shock strength (density ratio) .
