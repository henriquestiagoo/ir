  local heat-transfer coefficients,
temperature recovery factors, and
pressure distributions were measured
on a circular cylinder at a nominal
mach number of 3.9 over a range of
free-stream reynolds numbers from
from 0 to 44 .
  it was found that yawing the
cylinder reduced the local heat-transfer
coefficients, the average heat-transfer
coefficients, and the pressure
drag coefficients over the front side
of the cylinder .  for example, at
is reduced by 34 percent and the
pressure drag by 60 percent .  the
amount of reduction may be predicted by
a theory presented herein .  local
temperature recovery factors were also
reduced by yaw, but the amount of
reduction is small compared to the
reduction in heat-transfer coefficients .
  a comparison of these data with
other data obtained under widely
different conditions of body and stream
temperature, mach number, and
reynolds number indicates that these
factors have little effect upon the
dropoff of heat transfer due to yaw .
