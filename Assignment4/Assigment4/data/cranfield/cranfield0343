  turbulent recovery factor and heat-transfer measurements have been
made on a porous flat wall section at a nominal mach number of 3.0 and a
reynolds number of approximately 4 x 10 using both air and helium as the
transpired gas .  measured heat-transfer
coefficients correlate well with the
compressible theory of rubesin for air
and qualitatively with simple film
theory for either coolant, indicating that
the heat transfer from a turbulent
boundary layer can be reduced by transpiration
cooling to well below that of
the uncooled boundary layer at the same reynolds number .
