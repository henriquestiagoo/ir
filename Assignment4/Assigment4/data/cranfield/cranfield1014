<TEXT>
a problem of creep stability of columns and plates
is considered .  in an analysis use is made
of two forms of the creep theory based on the strain
hardening hypothesis .  for a uniformly compressed
palte a comparison is made between the
results according to the flow theory and strain
theory .
