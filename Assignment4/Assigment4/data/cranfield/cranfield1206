  features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a small
object in steady motion through a conducting fluid are examined .
these surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from the
object to the relevant wave-front diagrams .  the outer wave
cone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones have
cross sections similar to the cusped figures of the inner wavefront
diagram .  it is conjectured that the disturbance may be
concentrated along such line cusps .  this has particular relevance
in the application of known two-dimensional results to
three-dimensional problems, say in the well-known techniques
of aerodynamics .  in mhd the omission of the large disturbance
characteristics implicit in a two-dimensional solution may invalidate
its use in any practical three-dimensional problem .
